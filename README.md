MVC Start
===========
> This is my version of very basic CMS build with almost ready to use backend.
> The idea is that you have almost complete generic backend ready for use and extend and you are only left to create the front end of the site
> This project is usefull for sites that will have content such as: products, product categories, product features, product images, news, custom pages, gallery.
